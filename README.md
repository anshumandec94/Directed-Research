# Directed-Research
This repository contains all of the files and code I've used in my directed research and Master's Thesis work. 
This doesn't contain the data files I've generated on the multiple I've used. 
To work on the Java files, you would need to have the gradle package installed.
Unfortunately, the currently folder is too large and contains too many files to upload to GitHub.
The Folding_In.ipynb and the lkpyeval.py scripts can be run if you download the Lenskit 20M ratings set and change the filepath in the read statements in the code.
